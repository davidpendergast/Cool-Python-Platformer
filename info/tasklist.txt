    UI:
???     countdown before each level
        game completed menu
            -- show total time, total deaths, level individual times + deaths
            -- buttons to: try again, go to main menu, view replay(?)
        high score menu
            -- show grid of level #, name, best time, best run time, button to show replay
            -- view replays
                -- this would be cool
        level selection grid
            -- complicated, should have image of level start + name + number
            -- will have to load every level's json
                -- might be expensive for large level pack
    
    Main Menu:
        options
DONE        start full run
            single level grind mode
                -- need
            edit mode
                -- a little complicated, should flip on dev mode and start game?
                -- weird that editing window is a different size
                    -- will need to either standardize or expand/contract when starting/finishing edit mode
            select level path
                -- just click on level path text on main menu to cycle lol?
                -- wouldn't be good if you have a bunch for some reason
            settings
                player color
                    -- rgb text boxes, plus drawing of player with that color
???             dev mode
                    -- is this even needed if level edit mode exists?
                        -- not as dev mode currently stands, but might need some more dev-only stuff later?
                    -- true, false toggler on click
                keybindings
                    -- editable text box for each action for now
            
    Player Functionality:
        something to make walkoff instant-wallsnaps easier
            -- hold shift to do it automatically?
            -- hold shift to prevent walking off? then release to slide down?
DONE    buffer jump inputs
            -- adding even a 5 frame buffer would make instant jumps/walljumps much easier

    Settings:
            allow shift & ctrl modifiers for keybindings
    
    Entities:
        new blocks:
            normal block with no collision if player moving vertically upward
            scenery block, no collisions at all
                -- how to avoid being confusing?
                -- could be useful for distinguishing caves from open areas
        
    Optimizations:
        collision detection
            -- right now every actor is checked against every solid block
            solutions:
                -- enforce max block size and use chunking to store blocks?
                -- 512 by 512 is probably plenty big enough
                -- is this even the bottleneck? 
                    -- no 3D is by far
        drawing
            3D  
                -- gets choppy with a lot of objects onscreen
                -- should be able to do some caching with static blocks
            solve donut problem
            should cache path drawing in edit mode, no reason to recompute every frame
            
            
    Code Quality:
        standardize privatization of vars and methods
    
    Testing:
        level loading
            -- this requires either a collection of test levels (that require updating),
                    or some autogeneration scheme
            level loading test
            level loading -> saving -> reloading test
            stress testing
                autogenerate level with x random blocks
        physics
            -- ugg
        
    
    Level Editor:
        ability to: 
            place blocks
            edit block attributes (just edit their json?)
                paaaaaaths
                themes
                spawn stuff
            need to be able to see type of selected block
DONE        see paths
            
    Level Storage:
        header file is stupid
            -- just force levels to start with 01_name1.json, 02_name2.json, etc. ?
                -- what if levels lie?
            -- should do something reasonable if no header file exists
            -- should at least be json probably
DONE    revive void level and make it appear on level load fail instead of crashing
    
    General Storage:
        make localdata folder for highscores and settings to live
            -- that way level packs can be distributed without having to edit/remove your highscore files
        store highscores as ticks, and remove awful unformat_time method

| Known Bugs |
@~~~~~~~~~~~~@

    Physics Glitches:
!!!     walljumping on a platform moving away from you
            -- player needs to snap to moving vertical surfaces
!!!     weird smushes
            -- very wide blocks have issues crushing player
        falling wallsnaps
            -- feel very weird, pixel perfect spacing required to replicate. probably required 
                    for some optimal runs
            -- should be removed, or made easier to perform
!!!     when falling quickly, if player lands on a thin block it may treat it as a horizontal 
                collision instead of vertical
IGNORE? friction affected by fps
            -- character slides farther when fps is lower
IGNORE? pretty much everything affected by fps
            -- movement speed, jump height, etc. not a huge deal because fps will pretty much always
                be fixed at 60, but something isn't correct somewhere that's causing this behaviour.

    Art:
        animations?
            -- would at least benefit from death animations
            -- player/enemy animations of some kind would help too, even if the box just leans or
                stretches when moving, jumping, hanging on walls, etc.
        sprites?
            -- would like to keep it minimalistic if using sprites at all.
    
    Lighting:
        would HAVE to be static & precomputed
            -- but would be awesome if it was dynamic.....
            -- moving blocks creating darkness by blocking a ray of light...
            -- would have to make sure it doesn't look like shit
            
    3D:
        draw blocks with perspective lol
        
    Music/Sound:
        -- adds a lot to the atmosphere, also to the annoyance
